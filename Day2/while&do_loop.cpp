// it is same like for loop;

/*
syntax:
int i=0;
while(i<=10)
{
    i++;
}

//do while loop is although useless but it will run for atleast one time

syntax

do{
    code
}while(condition) if condition is true it will run again

 int i=11;
   
   do{
       cout<<i;
       i++;
   }while(i<=10);

   looking at this code we predict that it is a preloop and it will run 
    atleast once if the condition is false
